1. global execution context
2. function execution context


each execution context has 2 phases -memory phase
                                    -execution phase

-IN GLOBAL EXECUTION CONTEXT:
    Memory phase includes assigning memory to all the declared variables in the code one by one.
    Once that is done the execution phase will take over to generate the desired output.

-If in the code somewhere there is a function then inside the global execution context another function execution
context will be made. it will have its own memory phase as well as its own execution phase.

-If the global execution context is a square then, when it reaches the function another square will be formed inside of it.
